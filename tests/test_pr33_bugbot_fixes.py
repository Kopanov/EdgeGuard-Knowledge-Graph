"""Regression tests for the 3 bugbot findings on PR #33.

These tests pin down the fixes so a future refactor can't silently undo them:

1. **HIGH** — 6 standalone create_*_relationship helpers had bogus
   ``row.src_uuid`` / ``row.trg_uuid`` references in their non-UNWIND
   Cypher. Every call would crash at runtime. Fix: use bound endpoint
   variables (``a.uuid``, ``m.uuid``, ``i.uuid``, ``v.uuid``, ``s.uuid``,
   ``t.uuid``) instead — same Mechanism B pattern that ``build_relationships.py``
   uses.
2. **MED** — Tool→Technique IMPLEMENTS_TECHNIQUE branch passed
   ``{"name": nm}`` to ``edge_endpoint_uuids("Tool", …)``, but Tool's
   natural key is ``mitre_id`` → wrong uuid via ``__missing__`` fallback.
   Plus ``q_tool_implements`` Cypher MATCHed by ``tool.name = row.entity``
   but the Tool from_key in parse_attribute is ``{"mitre_id": …}``, so
   every Tool row was silently dropped. Fix: split the dispatch into
   per-label branches with the right key, MATCH by ``tool.mitre_id``.
3. **MED** — ``_NATURAL_KEYS`` and ``_LABEL_NATURAL_KEY_FIELDS`` were
   parallel maps that had to stay manually synced. Adding a label to one
   without the other silently produced wrong uuids. Fix: derive
   ``_LABEL_NATURAL_KEY_FIELDS`` from ``_NATURAL_KEYS`` so they cannot
   diverge.
